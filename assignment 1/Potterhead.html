            First thing first Dobby is really a underratted character.<br>
            As much as we remember Sirus or Fred or Remus as matyr of wizarding war, we don't remember Dobby.

           Dobby always wanted do something for harry. And remember dobby mentioning to harry that after downfall of Voldermort <br>
           many house-elf got treted little better but the situtation doesn't change for him.Even though situtation didnt change <br>
           for him he know how cruical or important was Voldermort's downfall for whole wizarding community.
